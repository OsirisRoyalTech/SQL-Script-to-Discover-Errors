To log the errors into a notepad, we can use INTO OUTFILE. Hereâ€™s how you can do it in MySQL:

SELECT user_id,
       user_name,
       email,
       age,
       join_date,
       CASE
           WHEN user_name IS NULL THEN 'Missing user_name'
           WHEN email IS NULL THEN 'Missing email'
           WHEN age <= 0 OR age > 120 THEN 'Invalid age'
           WHEN email NOT LIKE '%_@__%.__%' THEN 'Invalid email format'
           WHEN join_date > CURDATE() THEN 'Join date is in the future'
           ELSE 'No error'
       END AS error_type
FROM user_data
WHERE user_name IS NULL
   OR email IS NULL
   OR age <= 0
   OR age > 120
   OR email NOT LIKE '%_@__%.__%'
   OR join_date > CURDATE()
INTO OUTFILE '/path_to_file/user_data_errors.txt'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';

/*
Make sure that the MySQL server has write permissions to the specified directory for OUTFILE to work.
If you want to create a notepad file on your local system, you can use a scripting language like Python, PowerShell, or even a batch file to retrieve 
the results from the database and write them to a .txt file.
