This approach covers:
•	Identifying data errors in SQL.
•	Exporting those errors to a notepad or text file.
•	Cleaning the data with automatic fixes.

You'll need to adjust the paths and query details based on your specific environment and use case. If you have a more complex set of rules 
or need more flexibility, you can integrate this process into a larger ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework or use a more advanced scripting language.
